## CLI Commands

**Install**

```
npm install
```

**Start webpack-dev-server and dev node server**

```
npm start
```

**Start production server**

```
npm run serve
```

## Tech choices

**Frontend**

* React

**Backend**

* Node
* Express

I built the production backend using Express but re-created most of it (minus full static file serving) using plain Node for the sake of illustration. For a small scale API service Express would generally be unnecesary.

The express project structure is a bit contrived, but this is what I would use for a larger app.
